Home Assistant component for the Windcentrale & Winddelen

The `Windcentrale` component is a Home Assistant component which lets you get sensor and news data from all wind turbines.

The official websites are https://www.windcentrale.nl and https://winddelen.nl

## Example

Below is an example of the sensors.

## Sensors

### Live

These sensors show live data from the wind turbine.

|ID|Type|Description|Unit of Measurement|
|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| `sensor.name` | Int | The total amount of power you currently generate with the number of wind shares. | Watt (W) |
| `sensor.name_energy` | Int | The energy that the wind turbine has produced this year. | Kilowatt-hour (kWh) |
| `sensor.name_energy_prognoses_this_year` | Float | The percentage of how much the wind turbine should produce in a year. | Percentage (%) |
| `sensor.name_energy_shares` | Float | The energy that your shares of the wind turbine has produced this year. | Kilowatt-hour (kWh) |
| `sensor.name_hours_run_this_year` | Int | The number of hours the wind turbine has operated this year. | Hours (h) |
| `sensor.name_hours_run_total` | Int | The number of hours the wind turbine has operated in total. | Hours (h) |
| `sensor.name_last_update` | DateTime | Returns when the wind turbine last updated. | DateTime |
| `sensor.name_power_per_share` | Int | The power per wind share that the wind turbine currently generates. | Watt (W) |
| `sensor.name_power_percentage` | Int | The ability in percentage the wind turbine can generate power. | Percentage (%) |
| `sensor.name_power_total` | Int | The total power that the wind turbine currently generates. | Kilowatt (kW) |
| `binary_sensor.name_pulsating` | Bool | The wind turbine is at max power. | Boolean |
| `sensor.name_revolutions_per_minute` | Float | The speed at which the blades of the wind turbine rotate. | Revolutions Per minute (RPM) |
| `sensor.name_run_percentage` | Float | The percentage of the wind turbine is operational since the start date. | Percentage (%) |
| `sensor.name_wind_direction` | String | The direction of the wind at the wind turbine. | Wind rose |
| `sensor.name_wind_speed` | Int | The speed of the wind at the wind turbine. | Beaufort scale (BFT) |

### History

These sensors show how much power the wind turbine has delivered over a certain time.
These sensors are not displaying live data. These senors are updated around noon the following day.

|ID|Type|Description|Unit of Measurement|
|----------|------------|------------|------------|
| `sensor.name_production_year_total` | Int | The energy produced by the wind turbine total this year. | Kilowatt-hour (kWh) |
| `sensor.name_production_month_total` | Int | The energy produced by the wind turbine total this month. | Kilowatt-hour (kWh) |
| `sensor.name_production_week_total` | Int | The energy produced by the wind turbine total this week. | Kilowatt-hour (kWh) |
| `sensor.name_production_year_shares` | Int | The energy produced by your shares of the wind turbine this year. | Kilowatt-hour (kWh) |
| `sensor.name_production_month_shares` | Int | The energy produced by your shares of the wind turbine this month. | Kilowatt-hour (kWh) |
| `sensor.name_production_week_shares` | Int | The energy produced by your shares of the wind turbine this week. | Kilowatt-hour (kWh) |

### News

This sensor shows the latest news.

The value of `sensor.the_windcentrale_news` doesn't change because the news string is longer than 255 characters. There for the state is static and will always report `News`.

The attributes have no limit on characters there for I made a solution.

Create a markdown card with the following content: 
``` yaml
type: markdown
content: '{{ state_attr(''sensor.the_windcentrale_news'', ''News Item'') }}'
```

An example of what it should look like:

## Button

This button `button.the_windcentrale_update_wind_shares` updates your shares. The reason this a button and doesn't update automatically is because your shares doesn't change that often.

## Say thank you

There is put a lot of work into making this repo and component available.
If you want to make donation as appreciation of my work, you can buy me a coffee. Thank you!
