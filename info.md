Home Assistant component for the Windcentrale & Winddelen

The `Windcentrale` component is a Home Assistant component which lets you get sensor and news data from all wind turbines.

The official websites are https://www.windcentrale.nl and https://winddelen.nl

## Example

Below is an example of the sensors.

## Sensors

### History

These sensors show how much power the wind turbine has delivered over a certain time.
These sensors are not displaying live data. These senors are updated around noon the following day.

|ID|Type|Description|Unit of Measurement|
|----------|------------|------------|------------|
| `sensor.name_production_year_total` | Int | The energy produced by the wind turbine total this year. | Kilowatt-hour (kWh) |
| `sensor.name_production_month_total` | Int | The energy produced by the wind turbine total this month. | Kilowatt-hour (kWh) |
| `sensor.name_production_week_total` | Int | The energy produced by the wind turbine total this week. | Kilowatt-hour (kWh) |
| `sensor.name_production_year_shares` | Int | The energy produced by your shares of the wind turbine this year. | Kilowatt-hour (kWh) |
| `sensor.name_production_month_shares` | Int | The energy produced by your shares of the wind turbine this month. | Kilowatt-hour (kWh) |
| `sensor.name_production_week_shares` | Int | The energy produced by your shares of the wind turbine this week. | Kilowatt-hour (kWh) |

### News

This sensor shows the latest news.

The value of `sensor.the_windcentrale_news` doesn't change because the news string is longer than 255 characters. There for the state is static and will always report `News`.

The attributes have no limit on characters there for I made a solution.

Create a markdown card with the following content: 
``` yaml
type: markdown
content: '{{ state_attr(''sensor.the_windcentrale_news'', ''News Item'') }}'
```

An example of what it should look like:

## Button

This button `button.the_windcentrale_update_wind_shares` updates your shares. The reason this a button and doesn't update automatically is because your shares doesn't change that often.
