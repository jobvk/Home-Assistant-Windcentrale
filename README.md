## Installation

### Installation through HACS

1. Ensure that [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) is installed.
2. Click on the `+ Explore & add repositories`
3. Search for "Windcentrale" and install the integration.
4. Restart your instance.

### Manual Installation

1. Download the `windcentrale.zip` file from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/jobvk/Home-Assistant-Windcentrale/releases/latest).
2. Unpack the release and copy the files into the `custom_components/windcentrale` directory.
3. Restart your instance.

## Configuration

### Set Up

The Windcentrale component can be configured by config flow.

Go to Configuration and then Integrations, click on the `+ add integration`, select Windcentrale and configure the options on the form.
Fill in the amount of wind shares you own of the specific wind turbine(s). If you don't own wind shares of the other wind turbines, leave them on zero.

## Sensors

### Live

These sensors show live data from the wind turbine.

|ID|Type|Description|Unit of Measurement
|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| `sensor.name` | Int | The total amount of power you currently generate with the number of wind shares. | Watt (W)
| `sensor.name_current_power` | Int | The ability in percentage the wind turbine can generate power. | Percentage (%)
| `sensor.name_hours_run_this_year` | Int | The number of hours that the windturbine has been running this year. | Hours (h)
| `sensor.name_kwh` | Int | The amount of engery production by the windturbine this year. | Kilowatt-hour (kWh)
| `sensor.name_last_updated` | DateTime | Returns when the windturbine last updated. | DateTime
| `sensor.name_power_production_per_share` | Int | The power per wind share that the windturbine currently generates. | Watt (W)
| `sensor.name_power_production_total` | Int | The total power that the windturbine currently generates. | Kilowatt (kW)
| `binary_sensor.name_pulsating` | Int | The windturbine is at max power. | Boolean
| `sensor.name_revolutions_per_minute` | Int | The speed at which the blades of the windturbine rotate. | Revolutions Per minute (RPM)
| `sensor.name_run_percentage` | Int | The percentage of the wind turbine is operational since the start date. | Percentage (%)
| `sensor.name_wind_direction` | String | The direction of the wind at the windturbine. | Wind rose
| `sensor.name_wind_speed` | Int | The speed of the wind at the windturbine. | Beaufort scale (BFT)

### History

These sensors show how much power the wind turbine has delivered over a certain time.

|ID|Type|Description|Decimals|Unit of Measurement
|----------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| `sensor.name_day_production` | Int | The amount of power deliverd by the wind turbine this day. | 1 | Watt-hour (Wh)
| `sensor.name_week_production` | Int | The amount of power deliverd by the wind turbine last 7 days. | 1 | Kilowatt-hour (kWh)
| `sensor.name_month_production` | Int | The amount of power deliverd by the wind turbine this month. | 2 | Kilowatt-hour (kWh)
| `sensor.name_year_production` | Int | The amount of power deliverd by the wind turbine this year. | 3 | Megawatt-hour (MWh)
| `sensor.name_total_production` | Int | The amount of power deliverd by the wind turbine all time. | 3 | Megawatt-hour (MWh)

### News

This sensor shows the latest news.

The value of `sensor.the_windcentrale_news` doesn't change because the news string is longer than 255 characters. There for the state is static and will always report `News`.

The attributes have no limit on characters there for I made a solution.

Create a markdown card with the following content: 
```
type: markdown
content: '{{ state_attr(''sensor.the_windcentrale_news'', ''News Item'') }}'
```

An example of what it should look like:

## ToDo

* Report right state after restart
* Make the sensor available for Energy Management tab
